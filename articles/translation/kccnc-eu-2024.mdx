## 活动预告
CNCF 在 8 月在香港即将召开一系列同场活动：

- KubeCon + CloudNativeCon 聚集了来自领先的开源和云原生社区的采用者和技术人员。加入我们当前的毕业、孵化和沙盒项目，随着社区的聚集，进一步推动云原生计算的教育和发展。
- Open Source Summit 是开源开发者、技术专家和社区领袖的首要活动，他们可以合作、分享信息、解决问题、获取知识，推动开源创新，确保可持续的开源生态系统。这是开源代码和社区贡献者的聚集地。
- AI_dev: Open Source GenAI & ML Summit 是一个汇聚开发者的中心，他们深入探索开源生成式人工智能和机器学习的复杂领域。这个活动的核心信念是开源是推动人工智能创新的引擎。通过汇集来自世界各地最优秀的开发者，我们的目标是激发讨论，促进合作，并塑造开源人工智能的发展轨迹。

活动日期：

- CFP截止日期：中国标准时间（UTC +8），5 月 5 日星期日晚上 11:59 pm

- 日程公告：6 月 12 日（星期三）
0 幻灯片上传截止日期至Sched.com：星期三，8 月 14 日
- 活动日期：2024 年 8 月 21 日至 23 日

## 回顾要点
- TAG App Delivery 和 WG 平台在促进社区合作和知识共享方面做了出色的工作。
- 第一届 PE 日取得了巨大成功。
- 平台工程不仅在 PE 日期间被提及，而且还在其他不同活动中被提及。
- PE 讲座不再只是关于工具和构建模块，社区正在围绕平台即产品PaaP、平台的用户体验等方面的最佳实践提升讨论。
- 毫无意外，平台工程再次成为 KubeCon Paris 2024 期间讨论的热门话题。当然，AI/ML 也无处不在，但两者并不冲突！:)

> 开发人员的同理心至关重要！我们需要努力让云原生更好地为数据科学家服务。CNCF 内部强烈希望朝这个方向前进。

与之前的 KubeCon Chicago 2023 相比，我看到关于平台构建模块的讨论和讨论较少，相反，KubeCon Paris 2024 更多关注的是平台的功能和接口。重点更多的是围绕平台即产品和用户体验的客户故事和最佳实践。我非常欣赏这一点！

### 平台工程相关分享主题

在众多与平台工程相关的讲座中，我重点介绍其中 8 个我非常喜欢的讲座：

- [主题演讲：10年的轮回：容器化世界中应用交付的未来 — Solomon Hykes, Dagger.io](https://sched.co/1YhKQ) [视频回放](https://youtu.be/S_Z4AHZlSUI) — What became Docker was created 16 years ago, in Paris, wow! Solomon is keeping the Kubernetes and CNCF community honest, reminding us that there is a lot more to do to improve the Developer Experience. “Behind every great product there is a factory, and every factory is unique”.
- How Spotify Re-Created Our Entire Backend Without Skipping a Beat — Cluster migration planning as Product Manager: “who’s using the platform?” and “what is our impact to our business?”. Support to kind of Developers: “I don’t want to do Kubernetes, I want to deal with an abstraction” versus “I want a cluster-as-a-service to keep control”. Principles and strategy: take the pain with zero developer interaction.
- Sometimes, Lipstick Is Exactly What a Pig Needs! — Abby Bangser, Syntasso & Whitney Lee, VMware — Key success criterias of your Platform: Autonomy, Contextual distance and Capabilities versus Interfaces.
- AI-powered, paved road platform at Intuit. Application centric runtime (simplified workload specification), Traffic management and Developer friendly (debuggability tools — right in time debugging ephemeral container).
- Designing for Success: UX Principles for Internal Developer Platforms. Design is about how it works (Steve Jobs). Build an onboarding user journey map. Think about simple users as well as advanced users.
- Boosting Developer Platform Teams with Product Thinking. Product centricity: Value (why we do that? right thing to do? outcomes?) + Viability (who are our customers? will they use it? Empowered product person: Tech+UX+Eng with customer empathy. Developers have different context, incentives and needs.
- Panel: Navigating the Path to Platform Engineering Excellence: A Comprehensive Guide — Cortney Nickerson, Kubeshop; William Rizzo, SUSE; Abby Bangser, Syntasso; Areti Panou, SAP SE; Aparna Subramanian, Shopify
- Product Market Misfit: Adventures in User Empathy — User empathy is key. Ask your users, you’ll see assumptions versus reality results/learnings. Dog food your own work, shared perspectives comes from proximity. Never stop listening and learning from your users, invite critical feedback.

### Cloud Native StartupFest 云原生创业节 

注：这个部分对我来说非常重要，我很高兴看到专门为此举办同场活动。First*, Open Source (OSS) won’t be there if companies were not making business and money on top that. We are seeing a lot of Startup struggling on making money on top of OSS, and recently we have seen a lot of products changing their licensing (Terraform, Linkerd, Redis). We shouldn’t avoid such discussions.* Second*, the Startup world is very inspiring for any Platform Engineering initiative out there: Product Market Fit, Funding, Marketing, Sales, etc.*

- Startup Lessons from 25 Years and Five Startups — Tim Enwall, Fermyon Technologies, Inc. — Product Market fit, “Customers cash is 1000% better than Investors cash”, “You are always fundraising”, co-founders values alignment, build the best workplace ever (“amazing teams deliver outrageous results”), two essential traits: irrational belief + intimacy with fear and failure.
- Panel: Venture Capital and Open Source, the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly — Kelsey Hightower; Aneel Lakhani, Crane Venture Partners, Megan Reynolds, Vertex & Michael Yamnitsky, Insight Partners — True validation of a Product Market fit: “validating a real problem + find the first customer willing to fund/pay you for that”. “From being a tech person, you need to become a sales person as co-founder”. Be transparent about what not working today, and show that you are learning, solving real problems, etc.
- Fireside Chat with Kelsey Hightower and Alex Polvi, CEO, CoreOS, Inc — Wow! This one is amazing. I’m a big fan of Kelsey. He always mentions his time at CoreOS, that’s where now I understand how his own pivotal moment happened at CoreOS with Alex. Just listened and watched this one, if you want to know more.
- Is Your OSS Project Ready to Spin off Into a Company? — Arsh Sharma & Ramiro Berrelleza, Okteto; Idit Levine, Solo.io; Madhuri Yechuri, Elotl Inc.; Shauli Rozen, ARMO —” Is your project really used and getting feedbac from real customers (instead of just having GitHub stars)?”

### OpenShift 社区聚会
